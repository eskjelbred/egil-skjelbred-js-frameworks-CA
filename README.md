A React app with loginform and API requests

## Description

The Javascript Frameworks Cource Assignment for September 22 we were assigned to build a React or Next.js app with login functionality, we was assigned to create a Wordpress or Strapi installation to manage an API but the markers would use their own installation, therefor this app will not fetch any events without creating your own API requests. In this project i chose to work with React, Bootstrap and Sass with Yup-validation. Here are the assessments for this assignment:

- Your app should have the following paths:
  - "/"
  - "/detail/:param"
  - "/contact"
  - "/login"
  - "/admin"

Each one of these endpoints had their own details for what should be included

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Pre-requirements

This assignment requires you to run a service that provides an API for the functionality. This prerequired API is not provided.
